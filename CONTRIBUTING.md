visit our [support site][support] or our [forum][forum].
We are also available on [IRC][irc].

### Bug Reporting Guidelines

- **Important**: Report the issue using our [template][template], it includes all the
  information we need to track down the issue.
- **SECURITY**: Report any potential security bug by following our [security policy](https://elyranur.com/security/) instead of filing an issue in our bug tracker
- This repository is _only_ for issues within the Elyranur desktop client.
  Issues in other components should be reported in their own repositores:
  - [Elyranur server](https://github.com/elyranur/server/issues)
  - [Android client](https://github.com/elyranur/android/issues)
  - [iOS client](https://github.com/elyranur/ios/issues)
- Search the existing issues first, it's likely that your issue was already
  reported.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.
